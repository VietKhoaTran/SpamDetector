Spam Detection System

A machine learning project that classifies messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using a trained model. 
The system is based on a dataset of labeled spam and ham messages.

Model Training: The model is trained on a labeled dataset of spam and ham messages. 
It uses text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal) and feature extraction (CountVectorizer) followed by a machine learning algorithm (Naive Bayes).
